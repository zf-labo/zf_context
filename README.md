# ZF Context | NoPixel Inspired Context Menu
Simple and Easy to use Context Menu (Good replacement for ESX Menu Default)


# Information
I really loved the NeroHiro Context that he made so I've ended up re-creating a context menu like he had made because he unfortunately stop support it..
Hope you enjoy this "re-creation" of the nh-context with a new design that is more Luxurious version of it.

## Installation
To Install the ZF Context Menu, you need to download the code.
After you've downloaded the zf_context, install it in '[resource]/[local]/zf_context'.
Don't forget to start the resource in your server.cfg with `ensure zf_context`


## Usage
This is a default menu to show you how it works.
This is only for exemple.
```
RegisterCommand("testcontext", function(source, args, raw)
    TriggerEvent('zf_context:openMenu', {
        {
            id = 1,
            header = "Main Title",
            text = ""
        },
        {
            id = 2,
            header = "Sub Menu Button",
            text = "This goes to a sub menu",
            datas = {
                event = "zf_context:testMenu2",
                args = {
                    number = 1,
                    id = 2
                }
            }
        },
    })
end)
```
Or you can use the exported function
```
RegisterCommand('testcontext', function()
    local myMenu = {
        {
            id = 1,
            header = 'Header Title',
            txt = ''
        },
        {
            id = 2,
            header = 'Button',
            txt = 'Click here for help'
        }
    }
    exports['zf_context']:openMenu(myMenu)
end, false)
```
